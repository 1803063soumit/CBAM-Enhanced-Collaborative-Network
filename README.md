# CBAM Enhanced Collaborative Network for Binary Classification of Breast Tumours

## Overview

This project focuses on the binary classification of breast tumors as benign or malignant using a collaborative neural network enhanced with CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module). The goal is to leverage advanced deep learning techniques for accurate tumor classification in medical images.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the BreakHis_v1 dataset, which is a well-known collection of breast histopathology images. The dataset contains images of breast tissue samples annotated with information about the presence of benign or malignant tumors.

- **Dataset Name:** BreakHis_v1
- **Target Classes:** Benign, Malignant

## Technology Stack

The project is developed using the following technologies:

- **Python:** The primary programming language for development.
- **TensorFlow:** Deep learning framework for building and training neural networks.
- **Keras:** High-level neural networks API (utilized with TensorFlow) for building and training deep learning models.
- **DVC (Data Version Control):** Used for managing and versioning datasets to ensure reproducibility.
- **Flask:** Web framework employed for creating a web-based interface for the model.
